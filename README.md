### What I Learned

I learned how to use Flexbox to create a component of a professional website. Before I had only learned how to use Flexbox, but now I am working towards applying what I have learned.

I am proud of this CSS code. I was trying to figure out how to change the stats preview card with media queries, and this code helped me to achieve exactly what I was looking for.

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
    margin: 100px 80px;
  }
}
```

I am also proud of this CSS code. I realized that I had to add a violet tint to the image, and I was able to research how to do it online and choose the best solution based on my situation.

```css
.img {
  position: relative;
  border-radius: 15px 15px 0 0;
}

/* Violet tint for the image */
.img:before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: var(--soft-violet);
  z-index: 1;
  opacity: 0.5;
  border-radius: 15px 15px 0 0;
}
```

### Continued Development

I will continue to utilize Flexbox to create more websites and web components. I will also figure out how to make the component fit the screen width so there is not a scroll bar.

I really liked how straightforward and simple the different solutions were.
